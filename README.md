# MIR-IR and Classification
This project is the second project of Modern Information Retreival course in my bachelor studies and retreives information from hamshahrionline.ir news and classifies them.
In Part1 we index news and search through them (using Lucene library).
In Part2 we implement KNN and Naive Bayes, and use SVM and Random Forest (using scikit-learn) to classify these news into 14 categories.
